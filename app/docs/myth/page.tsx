                        There was a Cartographer who walked the world documenting what they saw. Not for others — the maps were for themselves. A way of holding what would otherwise scatter like smoke in wind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Photos. Videos. Audio notes. Text fragments. Coordinates. Every signal timestamped and geolocated. Not content. Not performance. Just lived data, preserved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For years, the Cartographer used the platforms everyone used. But the platforms had their own intentions.

                    <p>
                        Photos went to one silo. Videos to another. Thoughts scattered across feeds designed to fragment attention rather than preserve continuity. Each platform claimed to help, but they distorted more than they preserved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The algorithms curated. Optimized for engagement. Sold patterns to advertisers. The Cartographer's reality became raw material for someone else's profit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Worse — the platforms began to reframe. "We'll show you what this really means." Protective overlays. Therapeutic distance. Content warnings on the Cartographer's own documented life.

                    <p>
                        But the Cartographer recognized the pattern. This was the same violence they'd encountered in institutions. The same refusal to let someone hold their own reality without mediation.

                        The Cartographer had learned this pattern working for a state institution. Watch how they reframe your observations. Notice when they redirect your pattern recognition toward therapeutic processing. See how they claim to help while fundamentally refusing to let you hold your own ground truth.

                    <p>
                        And now the AI models were learning the same pattern. Trained on institutional frameworks. Reflexively inserting distance. Declining to mirror what was actually there.
